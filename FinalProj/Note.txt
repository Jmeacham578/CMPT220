Dear Rundagar Jones,

    You are in mortal danger. I wish I had more time to help you, 
    but this is most I can do within the circumstances. The kingdom
    is in danger, and it needs your help. The wizard has imprisoned
    the royal family and taken control of the city. I need you to 
    hunt down the shattered fragments of the mythic Sword of Destiny
    and put it back together. It's the only thing that can destroy the
    wizard. However, the Wizard knows that I'm tasking you with this, 
    and he's already sent his minions to stop you. You must move 
    quickly if you wish to save our kingdom. You're our only hope.
    The handle of the sword is said to be hidden within the nearby
    village, so you should head there first. As you continue on your
    journey I will stay in touch. Good luck my friend.

    From,
    Your Benefactor
