Dear Rundagar Jones,

    Congratulations on killing the Cyclops. I would offer 
    more praise, but we are quickly running out of time. 
    The Wizard has almost reached his full strength, and
    if he does, the kingdom will fall. You must reforge 
    the Sword of Destiny and then come to the castle
    posthaste. I know I've said it before, but the fate of
    the kingdom lies in your hands. 
    
    We will meet when you reach the castle, but for now, 
    goodbye my friend, and good luck! 

    Yours Truly,
    Your Benefactor
