Dear Rundagar Jones,

    My sources tell me that you've found the handle for the 
    Sword of Destiny. I must say, I didn't expect you to get 
    this far, but I'm pleased you have. Now, for the second half
    of the sword: the blade. To acquire the blade of the Sword 
    of Destiny, you must take it back from the monster that
    has been hoarding it these past few years. I hear he lives in 
    a coastal cave to the East. I would travel fast, the Wizard
    is wasting no time putting his plan into action. 

    Act quickly my friend, and good luck!

    You will hear from me again once you have reforged the mythic sword.

    Yours Truly,
    Your Benefactor
